## What is SurfShack?
> Surf_Shack aims to proved the user with a unique experience interacting with common surf data categories. 

##Usage
There are two main components to Surf_Shack

1. `MapView` with `Datum`'s:
This is where the surfer can interact with the data like never before. Datums provide common surf data in a new format that focuses on the surfers current location and heading. Rotating the `Datum`'s bring a new meaning to seeing *on-shore* and *glass conditions* from a surf report. 

2. `ReportView`: After a surf session, they jot down a quick recap of their session. Surf_Shack will take this report and use it provide future analysis on similar surf conditions to better notify the user of *firing* conditions.
