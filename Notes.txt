dont attempt to ExecuteUpdate forecast databases when I can know that the UNIQUE qualifier will fail
should not use fore-unwraps (!) in the execute update queiries. May get by on the wind forecast, but will fall apart when i get to the swell packets. 

grab spit cast data and parsing
clean up coating map
how do I move bezier paths after they are created
do the basic math to handle the tide drawing
how to draw multiple arrows for the swell directions
also how to scale them according to size (use maintain same point touching circumference of circle though!)
setting the map view center to NOT where the main datum is
	maybe select quadrants and only animate to either of the four corners
